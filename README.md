# devstream.tv

[devstream.tv](http://devstream.tv) is a site where streams of working developers are aggregated.

## Contributing

The entire site is client side, so you can download it and run it locally, or clone it and host it on your own github account.

Currently only twitch streams are supported.
If you want to add more streams, make a pull request or submit an issue.

The list of streams is in `data/streams.json`.
